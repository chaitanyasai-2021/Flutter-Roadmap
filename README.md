## What is Flutter ?
The open-source mobile application development platform called Flutter, developed by Google, has been quite popular in recent years, and this development is only expected to continue. Flutter is anticipated to become even more well-known among programmers and businesses trying to create cross-platform mobile applications in 2023.

## Why Flutter ?
You might already know that there are several frameworks available that offer cross-platform capability, but what sets flutter apart from the competition?

**Fast Development**
The quick reload feature of Flutter makes it effortless and speedy to test out new ideas, design UI, incorporate new features, and fix mistakes. Whether you are using iOS or Android devices, simulators or emulators, you can experience reload times in less than a second without losing any previous data.

</p>

**Native Performance**
To provide full native performance on both iOS and Android, Flutter's widgets consider all major platform differences, such as scrolling, navigation, icons, and fonts. You can find examples of applications built with Flutter. [Apps built with Flutter](https://flutter.dev/showcase)

**Better UI**
The Users will be pleased with Flutter's appealing in-built Material Design and Cupertino (iOS style) widgets, dynamic motion APIs, smooth and natural scrolling, and its ability to adapt to different platforms. [Check out the widget collection.](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/widgets)

## What is Dart ?
Okay, so now you know what Flutter is. We'll examine Dart's definition next because that is the programming language you will be using.
Once more, there is a YouTube video that might assist you there:

**Google Developers - Introducing Dart:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KlnlCq2M5Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KlnlCq2M5Q)

Perhaps you feel that this explanation falls short for you and that a more in-depth understanding of Dart is necessary. You should be aware that Dart and Flutter have excellent documentation, from which you could potentially learn everything. Because of this, I discovered an overview of Dart here:

[https://dart.dev/overview](https://dart.dev/overview)

Okay, now that we have learned what Flutter & Dart are, let's start installing Flutter & Dart.


## 🔧 Installation
Once you know how to do it, installing Flutter & Dart is not too difficult.

Given how excellent Flutter's documentation is, I've linked to every article you'll need to have a full Flutter setup here.

## 💻 Online Courses To Learn Flutter:
If you are a total newbie and are searching for some YouTube playlists or Udemy classes, I would suggest the following:

- [Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide [2023 Edition] (Udemy by Maximilian)](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/)
- [The Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart (Udemy by Angela-Yu)](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/)
- [Net Ninja (Youtube)]



## 🎯Dart Basics:

Before we can start, it’s quite important to understand the programming language we will be using over here for this reason, we will take a closer look at Dart's syntax.

If you're a beginner programmer, understanding OOP and stack data structures is a bonus!
Otherwise, you don't need to study Dart explicitly because it is pretty comparable to Java, C++, and C# and you will learn it as you go.

The Dart documentation includes a Language Tour, which is well-written and comprehensive. Although the article may be lengthy, if you have read it thoroughly and comprehended its content, you can confidently say that you are familiar with Dart syntax and capable of writing Dart code.
